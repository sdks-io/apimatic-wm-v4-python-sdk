# Walmart APIs SDK

[![Built with APIMatic][apimatic-badge]][apimatic-url] [![License: MIT][license-badge]][license-url] [![Python 3.10+][python-badge]][python-url]

The Walmart APIs SDK for Python provides access to the Walmart APIs REST APIs from Python applications.

OAuth token issuance for Walmart Marketplace, covering **both** v4 authorization
flows in one contract:

1. **Seller-direct** (`client_credentials`) — a seller's own application exchanges
   its client credentials for a short-lived access token, then calls the v4 APIs
   with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. **Solution-Provider delegated** (`authorization_code` + PKCE, `refresh_token`,
   and Dynamic Client Registration) — a seller grants a Solution Provider's
   application access to their Marketplace account.

Both flows are served by `the Authorization API` as a **stateless proxy** to
Walmart IAM : IAM remains the sole issuer; no secrets are stored and no
tokens are signed here. Access tokens are opaque, `Bearer`-type, short-lived;
refresh tokens (delegated flow) are rotated on use. Never log tokens.

## One token endpoint, grant dispatch
`POST /auth/v4/token` handles all three grants (`client_credentials`,
`authorization_code`, `refresh_token`) via `grant_type` dispatch — the merged v4
contract ( for seller-direct, for delegated). This is why the two
formerly separate specs (`openapi.yaml` + `delegated-oauth.yaml`) are now a single
document: a path can carry exactly one `post:`, so one file makes the shared
endpoint unambiguous for codegen and for the implementing controller.

## Posture
- **Seller-direct is OAuth 2.0** : documents what IAM/Apigee already do.
  IAM cannot add new auth features for this flow, so `client_credentials` issues
  **no** refresh token, `scope=` is accepted-but-ignored (no down-scoping), and
  introspection (RFC 7662) / revocation (RFC 7009) / discovery (RFC 8414) are
  **deliberately absent**.
- **Delegated is OAuth 2.1** : IAM already supports PKCE (`S256`), refresh
  rotation (~1-year TTL via `offline_access`), and Dynamic Client Registration
  (RFC 7591), so this flow specifies them properly.

The one modernization over `/v3` shared by both flows is the **access-token
header**: v4 uses the standard `Authorization: Bearer` and **does not use
`WM_SEC.ACCESS_TOKEN`** (the gateway already tolerates Bearer).

## Delegated-flow upstream gaps (, pending)
`GET /auth/v4/authorize` documents the OAuth-2.1-correct target. Three of its
guarantees depend on upstream changes that are **not yet in place**: `iss`
emission (RFC 9207), exact `redirect_uri` enforcement, and server-side PKCE `S256`
enforcement (rejecting `plain`) are IAM / app-store responsibilities tracked in
. the Authorization API validates the request-side invariants it can and
redirects correctly; the full end-to-end guarantee lands when IAM + app-store ship
those changes.

the Shipping API, and both front the same upstream (Ship With Walmart).
Per Suresh's SWW-consolidation analysis, every operation below is marked

reference only (tombstone) — no code is being built against it. New
seller-fulfilled shipping work goes to the Shipping API.

## Installation

Install the Python SDK from PyPI, with whichever package manager your project uses:

```bash
pip install walmart-apis
```

```bash
uv add walmart-apis
```

```bash
poetry add walmart-apis
```

---

## Quick Start

### Synchronous client

Construct `WalmartApisClient` with keyword arguments, and call `close()` when you are done. Every argument is optional; the full list is in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md).

```python
from walmart_apis import WalmartApisClient
from walmart_apis.auth import SellerAuthAuthorizationCodeScope, SellerAuthClientCredentialsScope, WalletAuthScope
from walmart_apis.core import AuthorizationCodeCredentials, BasicAuthCredentials, ClientCredentials


def prompt(url: str) -> str:
    return input(f"Open {url}, then paste the code: ")


client = WalmartApisClient(
    seller_auth_authorization_code=AuthorizationCodeCredentials[SellerAuthAuthorizationCodeScope](
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", redirect_uri="YOUR_REDIRECT_URI", prompt_for_authorization_code=prompt
    ),
    seller_auth_client_credentials=ClientCredentials[SellerAuthClientCredentialsScope](
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    ),
    basic_client_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"),
    wallet_auth=ClientCredentials[WalletAuthScope](client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"),
    environment="production",
)

# TODO: call endpoints here -- see api-reference.md

client.close()
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `with WalmartApisClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`Client` is exported as an alias of `WalmartApisClient`, so `from walmart_apis import Client` also works.

The SDK accepts every model-typed input in two interchangeable spellings, both type-checked: the typed model, or a plain dict with the same keys -- the `OrDict` and `Model | ModelDict` unions in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md). Pick whichever suits the call site: the dict form needs no import, while the model form adds a keyword-checked constructor and editor completion.

### Asynchronous client

`AsyncWalmartApisClient` mirrors `WalmartApisClient` with **identical method names**, and every endpoint method is a coroutine. It takes the same arguments, with some differences -- for example, the transport argument is `custom_async_http_client`.

```python
from asyncio import run, to_thread

from walmart_apis import AsyncWalmartApisClient
from walmart_apis.auth import SellerAuthAuthorizationCodeScope, SellerAuthClientCredentialsScope, WalletAuthScope
from walmart_apis.core import AsyncAuthorizationCodeCredentials, BasicAuthCredentials, ClientCredentials


async def prompt(url: str) -> str:
    print(f"Open {url}")
    return await to_thread(input, "Paste the code: ")


async def main() -> None:
    client = AsyncWalmartApisClient(
        seller_auth_authorization_code=AsyncAuthorizationCodeCredentials[SellerAuthAuthorizationCodeScope](
            client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", redirect_uri="YOUR_REDIRECT_URI", prompt_for_authorization_code=prompt
        ),
        seller_auth_client_credentials=ClientCredentials[SellerAuthClientCredentialsScope](
            client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
        ),
        basic_client_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"),
        wallet_auth=ClientCredentials[WalletAuthScope](client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"),
        environment="production",
    )
    # TODO: call endpoints here, awaiting each -- see api-reference.md
    await client.aclose()


run(main())
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `async with AsyncWalmartApisClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit. Only the async spelling is `aclose`, matching httpx; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`AsyncClient` is the exported alias. Each client accepts **only** its own transport argument and its own prompt flavour; passing the other's is a `TypeError` at runtime and an error under mypy.

## Usage

Two generated references cover the SDK; each answers a different question:

| Reference | For |
| --- | --- |
| **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** | Usage guidance for a single **parsed** operation: `client.<group>.<operation>(...)` returns the typed payload and raises `ApiError` on any non-2xx, with `.error` the typed error body, or `RawError` for a status the operation does not document. |
| **[Raw API Reference](raw-api-reference.md)** | The same for the **raw** variant: `client.<group>.with_raw_response.<operation>(...)` returns `ApiResult[T, E]` and never raises for an API error. |

Both API references carry every one of the 174 operations, with a sync and an async sample and a parameter table each.

## SDK map

This SDK ships a generated **SDK map** -- [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md) -- a deterministic, lookup-oriented table of contents of the SDK's Python surface, generated by APIMatic alongside this SDK.

Consult the map before scanning or grepping the source: it answers call-level contract questions by lookup, and for anything it does not carry -- model shapes, enum values, an endpoint's route or behavioural prose -- it names the one source file to read. How to read the map itself, including the SDK-wide defaults its rows rely on, is stated at the top of [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md).

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> Use a **single `WalmartApisClient` instance** for the lifetime of your application and reuse it across
> all requests. Each instance owns its own connection pool, so an instance per request forfeits
> connection reuse and leaks pools that are never closed.

Match the disposal to the client's lifetime: an application-lifetime client is closed once at shutdown with `close()` / `aclose()`; where the lifetime fits a block, `with WalmartApisClient() as client:` / `async with AsyncWalmartApisClient() as client:` releases it automatically. Both are idempotent, but a closed client is not reusable: the next call raises. The client closes **whatever transport it holds**, including one you supplied via `custom_http_client` / `custom_async_http_client`; if you intend to reuse your own transport across clients, don't hand its lifetime to a `with` block.
