        ### Current limitations (roadmap)

        The underlying the Orders service backend does not yet support every filter declared below. Calls using any of
        the following will return ``400 Bad Request`` with ``code=FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED`` and a human-readable
        ``message`` explaining the specific rejection. Phase 2 will lift these one-by-one as the underlying service adds
        capability.

        | Filter | Status today | Reason |
        |---|---|---|
        | ``createdAfter``, ``createdBefore`` | Rejected (400) | the Orders service does not accept date-range filters
            at the order level. |
        | ``lastUpdatedAfter`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service has no order-level update-date index. |
        | ``orderStatuses`` with >1 value | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one status per call; pass a
            single value or omit to match all. |
        | ``fulfillmentTypes`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call; multi-type
            fan-out is Phase 2. |

        These parameters remain in the contract (rather than being removed) so that SDKs generated today stay
        forward-compatible with the the roadmap surface — your code keeps compiling, only the runtime behaviour changes
        when Phase 2 ships. Until then, omit them or handle the documented 400 gracefully. The ``tools/loadgen-orders.sh
        --contract`` smoke sweep exercises the rejection contract on every run.

        Args:
            created_after: Filter orders created after this date-time (ISO 8601). **the roadmap — not yet supported.**
                Sending this parameter today returns ``400 FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED``; the Orders service does not accept
                date-range filters at the order level. Tracked by . Retained in the contract so SDKs generated today
                stay forward-compatible.
            created_before: Filter orders created before this date-time (ISO 8601). **the roadmap — not yet supported.**
                See ``createdAfter`` for the rationale and the tracking ticket.

                no order-level update-date index. Tracked by .
            order_statuses: Filter by order status. **the roadmap limitation:** the Orders service accepts AT MOST ONE

                or omit to match all. Multi-status fan-out tracked by .
            fulfillment_types: Filter by fulfillment type. **the roadmap — not yet supported.** Sending this parameter
                today returns ``400 FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED``; the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call and
                multi-type fan-out is Phase 2. Tracked by .

        ### Current limitations (roadmap)

        The underlying the Orders service backend does not yet support every filter declared below. Calls using any of
        the following will return ``400 Bad Request`` with ``code=FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED`` and a human-readable
        ``message`` explaining the specific rejection. Phase 2 will lift these one-by-one as the underlying service adds
        capability.

        | Filter | Status today | Reason |
        |---|---|---|
        | ``createdAfter``, ``createdBefore`` | Rejected (400) | the Orders service does not accept date-range filters
            at the order level. |
        | ``lastUpdatedAfter`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service has no order-level update-date index. |
        | ``orderStatuses`` with >1 value | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one status per call; pass a
            single value or omit to match all. |
        | ``fulfillmentTypes`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call; multi-type
            fan-out is Phase 2. |

        These parameters remain in the contract (rather than being removed) so that SDKs generated today stay
        forward-compatible with the the roadmap surface — your code keeps compiling, only the runtime behaviour changes
        when Phase 2 ships. Until then, omit them or handle the documented 400 gracefully. The ``tools/loadgen-orders.sh
        --contract`` smoke sweep exercises the rejection contract on every run.

        Args:
            created_after: Filter orders created after this date-time (ISO 8601). **the roadmap — not yet supported.**

                date-range filters at the order level. Tracked by . Retained in the contract so SDKs generated today

                or omit to match all. Multi-status fan-out tracked by .
            fulfillment_types: Filter by fulfillment type. **the roadmap — not yet supported.** Sending this parameter
                today returns ``400 FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED``; the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call and

        The underlying the Orders service backend does not yet support every filter declared below. Calls using any of
        the following will return ``400 Bad Request`` with ``code=FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED`` and a human-readable
        ``message`` explaining the specific rejection. Phase 2 will lift these one-by-one as the underlying service adds
        capability.

        | Filter | Status today | Reason |
        |---|---|---|
        | ``createdAfter``, ``createdBefore`` | Rejected (400) | the Orders service does not accept date-range filters
            at the order level. |
        | ``lastUpdatedAfter`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service has no order-level update-date index. |
        | ``orderStatuses`` with >1 value | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one status per call; pass a
            single value or omit to match all. |
        | ``fulfillmentTypes`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call; multi-type
            fan-out is Phase 2. |

        These parameters remain in the contract (rather than being removed) so that SDKs generated today stay
        forward-compatible with the the roadmap surface — your code keeps compiling, only the runtime behaviour changes
        when Phase 2 ships. Until then, omit them or handle the documented 400 gracefully. The ``tools/loadgen-orders.sh
        --contract`` smoke sweep exercises the rejection contract on every run.

        The underlying the Orders service backend does not yet support every filter declared below. Calls using any of
        the following will return ``400 Bad Request`` with ``code=FILTER_NOT_SUPPORTED`` and a human-readable
        ``message`` explaining the specific rejection. Phase 2 will lift these one-by-one as the underlying service adds
        capability.

        | Filter | Status today | Reason |
        |---|---|---|
        | ``createdAfter``, ``createdBefore`` | Rejected (400) | the Orders service does not accept date-range filters
            at the order level. |
        | ``lastUpdatedAfter`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service has no order-level update-date index. |
        | ``orderStatuses`` with >1 value | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one status per call; pass a
            single value or omit to match all. |
        | ``fulfillmentTypes`` | Rejected (400) | the underlying service accepts one shipNodeType per call; multi-type
            fan-out is Phase 2. |

        These parameters remain in the contract (rather than being removed) so that SDKs generated today stay
        forward-compatible with the the roadmap surface — your code keeps compiling, only the runtime behaviour changes
        when Phase 2 ships. Until then, omit them or handle the documented 400 gracefully. The ``tools/loadgen-orders.sh
        --contract`` smoke sweep exercises the rejection contract on every run.
